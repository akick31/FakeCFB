# Introduction

This GitHub is the repository for the /r/FakeCollegeFootball's mobile companion application. In here you will find the code for the application.

# What is FakeCFB?

/r/FakeCollegeFootball is an online Reddit based game where users play other users in a college football themed game by submitting a number between 1-1500, the difference in numbers between what the offense calls and what the defense calls determines the result of the play. In general, the bigger the number difference (up to 750), the better the play for the defense, and the smaller the number difference, the better the play for the offense
